# StormWizard-Demos
Amiga code! This Repo contains some Demos on how to write code for Amiga wizard.library and GUI builder in C. In order to build them, you will need at least:
- Amiga or Emulator running Workbench 3.1, 3.1.4 or 3.9
- StormWizard GUI builder, wizard.library and include files. You can get them here: http://stormwizard.amiforce.de/Download/stormwizard_2.3.lha
- a decent C compiler with AmigaOS 3.9 NDK installed - SAS/C, vbcc or gcc v2.95 suggested. You can get the NDK here: https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=2ahUKEwjMt_erz6ffAhWJGuwKHfJjAFEQFjAAegQIBxAB&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.haage-partner.de%2Fdownload%2FAmigaOS%2FNDK39.lha&usg=AOvVaw1lW3bgBPVzO4NCgRnREGjF

# Cave at
This code might some bugs, though having been tested and found working! Programs use german language for their GUI - there are no translations available yet.

# Compiling
...should be done on a real or emulated classic Amiga. You might also use some Amiga Cross Compiler toolchain on a PC or Mac. Be aware that you have to place the neccessary linker libs and include files into the right places by hand!
